## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges at KNUST
1. **Unpredictable Shuttle Arrival Times**: Students often wait for extended periods at shuttle stands without knowing when shuttles will arrive
2. **Poor Time Management**: Difficulty in planning departure times from hostels to catch shuttles
3. **Lack of Communication**: No platform for students to provide feedback about shuttle services
4. **Inefficient Route Planning**: No visibility into shuttle locations and optimal routes
5. **Limited Accountability**: No system to track driver performance or service quality

### Impact on Students
- Late arrivals to lectures and academic activities
- Wasted time waiting at shuttle stands
- Increased stress and frustration
- Poor academic performance due to transportation issues
- Lack of voice in service improvement

---

## Project Motivation

### Personal Experience
The project was born from personal frustration with the existing shuttle system at KNUST. As a student, I experienced:
- Waiting 30+ minutes at shuttle stands without any information
- Missing lectures due to unpredictable shuttle schedules
- No way to provide feedback about poor service
- Difficulty planning my daily schedule around transportation

### Vision
To create a comprehensive solution that:
- Provides real-time visibility into shuttle locations
- Enables better time management for students
- Creates accountability for shuttle services
- Improves overall transportation experience at KNUST
- Serves as a model for other universities
